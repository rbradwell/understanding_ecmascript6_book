special arrays to work with numerical types as prot of OpenGL ES2.0 port.
provide bitwise arithmetic in javascript.
native javascript numbers were too slow becuase sotre as 64bit and converted to 32 bits as needed.

any single number can be treat as an array of bits.  Therefore can use array methods on it.

standard javascript only uses 64 bits to represent floats or integers.

typed arrays introduced int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, float32, float64
